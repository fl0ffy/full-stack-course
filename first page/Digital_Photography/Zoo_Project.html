        <h1>Zoo</h1>
        <h2>Artist's Statement</h2>
        <p>
            This series of photographs is a documentary of animals at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington DC. My goal was to capture animals in as natural a state as possible given constraints of captivity.  While shooting I also, was limited by the range of zoom so each animal captured in a photograph give some idea of how close you can observe them.  The photos taken outdoors did not require much adjustment as the day was overcast and provided favorable soft light.  I did however attempt to bring the animals out of the shadows when necessary.   The photos indoors were difficult as I was dealing with a variety or heating, display, and natural light bulbs, reflections, and pedestrians in close proximity.  Most of those photos needed some more brightening and evening out of colors.

        <h4>Framing of the honey bee hive</h4>
        <p>
            I wanted a pairing of mats that would complement the colors of the photo without distracting from the photo.  I also wanted to choose more natural colors as the subject pertained to animals in a wild-like atmosphere.  The frame choice was similar, I wanted natural looking wood that complimented the coloring of the subject within the photo.  Overall, the size I choose was limited the available paper size I had so I went with the largest size I could print and not require a custom frame which was 8x10 opening in a 11x14 frame.  I hope the framing adds to the atmosphere of the subject in a natural environment.
