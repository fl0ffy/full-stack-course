        <h2>Artist's Statement</h2>
        <p>
            In this series of photographs, I explore reflective items as they capture a normal day in this abstract/documentary/narrative portrait concept. We live with things that allow us to see ourselves and normally they are associated with vanity. I wanted to capture the everyday activities that are visible through reflections.  I attempted to shoot during the time of day the portrayed activity takes place and in each give the feeling of that time of day and location. This created a wealth of different lighting situations from blue cast dark computer light filled office to the slightly over-exposed bright day as the sun hits your face as you’re driving to work.  Most of the post editing was removal or dust, dirt, and reflective imperfections.  I stayed away from blemish removal as there weren’t too many nor did I want to detract from the rawness of the character being portrayed in mundane activities.  Some of them only required minor corrections but a couple required balancing the realness of the situation and setting with a clear and clean photograph. I mostly worked zoomed in so may have done some overkill on a few sections.  I used the spot healing brush tool a bit but due to the number or textured surfaces I found that the clone stamp tool was preferrable.
