        <h1>Conceptual Landscape</h1>
        <h2>Artist's Statement</h2>
        <p>
            In this series of photographs, I attempt look at the classical man vs nature concept in a documentary style while also suggesting at a commentary of the dualistic nature of man. The setting of all the images is a lot being cleared off a highway in a small town that has had an influx of new commercial developments while several older commercial properties are left unused or abandoned. I tried to show the clearing of land via large machine and the clearing against the remains of trees piled up waiting for removal.  In the background you can see the surrounding trees watching as the ground is cleared by large construction equipment.  I tried to show this as a warm inviting space making it feel as if what is happening is friendly. A type of satirical take on the dualistic nature of humans, demanding to stop climate change and be kind to the earth while at the same time clamoring for more business locations when there are so many unused structures nearby.  I hope that through these photographs, viewers can begin to at least acknowledge this particular display of overindulgence and waste even if a clear solution or action on their part may not be visible.
